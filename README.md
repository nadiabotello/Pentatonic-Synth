<h1>Interactive Pentatonic Synthesizer --</h1>

Minimalist, browser-based synthesizer built with P5 (JavaScript) that generates random sequences of notes 
drawn from a minor pentatonic scale, and allows the user to interact with the composition by moving the cursor 
to change the octave of the note palette.
